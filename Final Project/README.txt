Final Project
COMP-5970-D01
July 27, 2021

This app has two functionalities, which is a simple calculator and
a simple tip calculator. These are two functionalities I felt like 
I personally would use on a day-to-day basis. I also felt like the
difficulty of this app is the same as the weekly assignments.  

How to Run:
The latest version of XCode with default project settings have been used,
there is no reason this build should not run. A video is included in the
zipped file for extra measure for the TA. Just open the project workspace on XCode and click run button. 

Simple calculator:
- Calculates simple algebra
- Click "Calculator" button to open
- Click and scroll down the top of the detail-view to close the calculator

Simple tip calculator:
- Calculates percentage of tip and total bill amount including the tip
- Click "Tip" button to open
- Click and scroll down the top of the detail-view to close the tip calculator

Although there are constraints added to each view/button, the following
devices are preferred to get the full app experience. 

Devices:
iPhone 11 Pro Max
iPhone 11
iPhone 8 Plus
